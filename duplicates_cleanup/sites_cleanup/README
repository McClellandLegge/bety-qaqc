Plan for eliminating site duplicates.

1. Run a query to find groups with the same non-empty sitename value.

2. For each group, run a more detailed query to compare other column values and
numbers of linked associations.

3. Choose a member of the group to keep, and reconcile missing or conflicting
information with other members of the group.  At the end of this process, each
column value in each row being eliminated should either be empty or should match
the value in the row being kept.

4. Run the script to eliminate duplicates and reassign references to the row
being kept.

5. Repeat steps 1 to 4 using the -r flag in steps 1 and 2 to examine like-named
sites whose location is not exactly the same.

6. Repeat steps 1 to 5 but including sites with empty sitename value (use the -s flag).
